          <h2>Online-Learning Podcast</h2>
          <p class="description">
            The pandemic changed all of our lives: people lost their jobs, loved ones, and so many valuable life experiences. We as students faced unprecedented circumstances, seniors around the world had their graduations taken away, the freshman had their first years online, and most had to study online.

          <h2>My Favorite Artist: LANY</h2>
          <p class="description">
            LANY is my favorite band/artist. Their music is really calming and it's a really great escape from the hectic world of being a sophomore CS student. In fact, I love them so much that my college friends actually all call me LANY, and we even named all of our group chats "LANY Fan Club" — this was even what we wrote on the Brooklyn Bridge, which is what the picture is. One of my favorite songs by LANY is Malibu Nights, arguably their most famous song. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xxhaKm1RQ" target="_blank">Have a listen!</a></p>

          <h2>Recipe Finder Application</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I combined my Java experience and internship-based app development knowledge to program an android application, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm2GPx0uqTc" target="_blank">"Recipe Finder"</a>, with a friend. Together, we used Android Studio and a real-time code sharing plug-in to type through each and every line of code together. Our application takes two user-based inputs: a comma separated list of ingredients and a number of missing ingredients that the user is willing to obtain. The app broadcasts this information to the Spoonacular API — procuring an output of possible recipes onto a scrollable list, arranged from least to most by the number of missing ingredients the user will need to obtain per recipe. The scrollable list allows users to select their recipe of choice and have a full ingredients list and recipe on display through further communication with the API.</p>
